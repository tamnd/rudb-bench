//! A latency histogram with a fixed relative error, the same layout as `rudb-metrics` has.
//!
//! `notes/Spec/2140/engine-v4/16-measurement.md` section 16.4 asks the write workloads for a
//! histogram per operation type, and section 16.2 already put one in the engine. This is that one,
//! copied rather than depended on, because the harness takes no dependencies and because the driver
//! and the engine have to agree on the layout to the bit: a histogram a driver records and one the
//! engine reports are merged and compared, which only works when both slot a value the same way.
//! The test `the_layout_is_the_one_the_spec_sized` pins the numbers the engine's copy pins too.
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! Two significant digits means any value up to 200 is kept exactly and any larger value is kept to
//! within one part in a hundred. That needs 256 slots in the first bucket, a power of two because
//! the index is computed with shifts. Every bucket after the first covers twice the range of the one
//! before with the same 128 slots in its upper half, so its resolution halves as its range doubles
//! and the relative error stays where it was. The lower half of every bucket but the first would
//! repeat values the bucket below already holds, and it is not stored.
//!
//! The range is 1 ns to 100 s, which is 30 buckets and 3,968 slots, 31 KiB of `u64`, per worker. A
//! worker records into its own histogram with plain adds, and a reader merges them, and merging two
//! of these is adding two arrays.
//!
//! A value past the top is recorded at the top and counted in [`Histogram::clamped`], rather than
//! dropped, so a count of operations is never short.
//!
//! # Across a process
//!
//! The in-process drivers run as a child of the harness and never inside it, so a histogram has to
//! cross a pipe. [`Histogram::to_line`] writes one line of text with only the occupied slots in it,
//! and [`Histogram::from_line`] reads it back to the same histogram, bit for bit.

/// Values up to this are kept exactly. Two significant digits is two times ten to the second.
